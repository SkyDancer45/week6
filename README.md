# Setting Up Internal and Public Load Balancers

This repository documents the setup of two load balancers: one internal and one public, following the guidelines from Microsoft Azure documentation. Below is a detailed summary of the steps taken and configurations applied.

## Overview

In this project, I implemented two types of load balancers to manage traffic efficiently within a network environment:

- **Internal Load Balancer**: This load balancer directs traffic within a virtual network (VNet) or cloud service, ensuring high availability and scalability for internal applications or services.
  
- **Public Load Balancer**: Designed to manage incoming internet traffic to your hosted applications, the public load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure application availability and responsiveness.

## Steps Taken

### Internal Load Balancer

1. **Configuration**:
   - Created an internal load balancer within my Azure environment.
   - Configured backend pools to include virtual machines (VMs) hosting internal services.
   - Set up health probes to monitor the availability of backend VM instances.
   - Defined load balancing rules to distribute traffic to backend VMs based on defined criteria (e.g., round-robin, session-based).

2. **Deployment**:
   - Used Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates to define and deploy the internal load balancer.
   - Verified connectivity and ensured internal services were accessible via the load balancer's private IP address.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Conducted testing to ensure that the internal load balancer effectively distributed traffic among backend VMs.
   - Monitored performance metrics to validate load balancing efficiency and responsiveness.

### Public Load Balancer

1. **Configuration**:
   - Created a public load balancer to handle incoming internet traffic to public-facing applications.
   - Configured frontend IP configurations, defining public IP addresses and ports exposed to external clients.
   - Set up NAT rules and inbound NAT rules to translate incoming traffic and direct it to the appropriate backend resources.

2. **SSL Termination**:
   - Implemented SSL termination at the load balancer to offload SSL decryption and reduce the computational load on backend servers.
   - Configured security rules to restrict traffic and ensure only authorized connections are allowed.

3. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   - Established monitoring alerts to track the performance and health of the public load balancer.
   - Optimized load balancing settings and rules based on observed traffic patterns and application requirements.

## Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Ensured that both load balancers were secured using network security groups (NSGs) and firewall rules to restrict access appropriately.
- **Scaling**: Prepared for scalability by configuring autoscaling options for backend VMs and load balancer instances.
- **Documentation and Maintenance**: Documented all configurations and deployment steps for future reference and maintenance.

## Conclusion

This project successfully deployed and configured both internal and public load balancers in accordance with Microsoft Azure best practices. The setup ensures reliable application delivery, scalability, and efficient traffic management within the network environment.
